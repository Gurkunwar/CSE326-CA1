In our blog, the celebrity we are going to analyse is Cristiano Ronaldo.<br> 
Ronaldo grew up in Portugal as achild playing for local teams before becoming an <br>
international superstar.Further into his success Ronaldo hasbecome one of the most <br>
influential athletes in sport. This is shown throughout his global following which includes,<br>
99.1 million on Twitter, 429 million in Instagram and 150 million on Facebook. With <br>
almost 400 million followers, he is in an exclusive class of the most followed athletes.<br>
 But this comes with big responsibilities as being a positive role model to hundreds <br>
of millions of passionate followers. So far Ronaldo has proven that he can balance being<br>
 a father to four children, a professional athlete and a positive role model to the world<br>
 through his social media. Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the most successful Soccer athletes<br>
 of all time with accolades of 5 Ballon d’Or’s (tied for most) and over 31 League titles <br>
throughout the toughest competition around Europe. He is also the only athlete to win 4 <br>
European Golden Shoes. This is for the Soccer player who scores the most goals within a <br>
season throughout Europe. With such a large following, businesses are always wanting the<br>
 opportunity to partner with Ronaldo. He is one of three athletes to be given a lifetime <br>
deal with Nike (After Michael Jordan and Lebron James) worth 1 Billion dollars. It is <br>
reported that Ronaldo earns 35 million pounds a year through endorsements and output on <br>
social media. Companies which he has publicly shared his posts through his social media <br>
include Nike, Herbalife, TAG Heuer, American Tourister, Egyptian Steel, PanzerGlass, and <br>
Toyota. Like other athletes, Ronaldo had taken advantage of his platform and created his <br>
own label selling a wide variety of products. These includes Cristiano Ronaldo Legacy <br>
(Cologne), CR7 Blankets, CR7 Footwear and CR7 Luxury Underwear. These products can be seen <br>
worn by Ronaldo in many of his social media posts with the link to purchase these products <br>
in the bio. Lots of his products can be found online and now retail stores worldwide are <br>
beginning to supply his products. In Australia, retail outlets have been selling the CR7 <br>
Luxury Underwear. Ronaldo also uses his platform to express his message and support to <br>
serval causes. Most notably, he has partnered for foundations Save the Children, UNICEF and<br>
 World Vision. This is because he wants to help people less fortunate have opportunities to<br>
 become the best they can be and reduce poverty. This is close to Ronaldo as he was brought <br>
up from humble beginnings and given opportunities from others who believed in him. This is<br>
 also shown publicly through his social media and making charitable donations in hope that<br>
 others will follow his footsteps and help reduce the cause. Cristiano Ronaldo is another <br>
example to the world that regardless of upbringing, quality of life that anyone is able to <br>
achieve their dreams and become a positive influence globally.
